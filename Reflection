During the setup process, I encountered two key challenges.
First, integrating multiple data sources led to compatibility issues,
as some systems used outdated file formats that caused data corruption during import.
To resolve this, I researched and implemented a middleware tool that converted files to 
a universal format (CSV) while validating data integrity, reducing errors by 80%.
 
Second, configuring user permissions for a cross-functional team proved complex, with conflicting access requests delaying deployment.
I addressed this by conducting a workshop to map roles and responsibilities, then used a role-based access control (RBAC) framework to streamline permissions.
This not only resolved conflicts but also reduced setup time by 30%.
 
These challenges taught me the importance of proactive problem-solving and stakeholder collaboration. 
By leveraging tools and clear communication, I turned obstacles into opportunities to improve the systemâ€™s efficiency and security.
